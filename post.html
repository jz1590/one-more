                        <p>I asked Chat and my parents to describe me in their own words and their responses fall below</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What Chat-GPT said about me</h2>
                        <p>You're pursuing accounting at BYU and have taken steps like joining competitions (and even winning one!). You're serious about building a solid future—possibly through a CPA license, a master's in accounting, or even an MBA. That shows ambition paired with a long-term mindset.</p>
                        <p>You've asked about CFO paths, job markets in dentistry (and other fields), and specific salary data—suggesting that you're not just thinking about your education, but about how it translates into real-world value. You also actively look for internships and part-time opportunities, showing initiative and practical thinking.</p>
                        <p>You consistently thank me, organize your thoughts clearly, and follow up in a structured way. That implies strong communication skills and a respectful demeanor—likely qualities that others appreciate in both academic and professional settings.</p>
                        <p>You're training for a half marathon and learning about exercise routines—evidence of physical discipline and a balanced lifestyle. You've also asked about diet, food storage, and recipes, so you likely value wellness in a broad sense.</p>
                        <p>Your questions span topics from psychology (e.g., Dunning-Krueger effect, motivation psychology) to religion, food science, and economics. You're not just trying to get through school—you genuinely want to understand how things work.</p>
                        <p>You've brought up scriptures (like 1 Nephi 1:1), the LDS church, and even created Bishopric meeting agendas. That suggests you're actively engaged in your faith and community, and likely value service and leadership.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">If I had to summarize - You're a thoughtful, faith-centered, and driven individual who's striving for personal, academic, and professional growth. You approach your goals with discipline, curiosity, and a clear moral compass.</blockquote>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What my Parents said about me</h2>
                        <p>Mom | Jack is a natural leader who is confident and determined in everything he does. He is very responsible, making him someone you can always count on. His love for God shapes his values and guides the way he lives his daily life.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/parent_picture.jpg" alt="Jack with Parents" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>Dad | You are a high-character individual and a man of faith. You are gentle and kind to those around you. You are passionate about things that you love and appreciate. You enjoy a good laugh. You are athletic and enjoy being busy.</p>
